// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Read num1=a
Read num2=b

(sum=num1+num2)
(sum=a+b)

Print Sum

Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Read num1=b
Read num2=a=2

if a%b=whole number print "even"
if a%b=number with remainder print "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Read num1
Read num2
Read num3
Read num4
Read num5

Array (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)=sum
sum/5=avg
print avg

Array (num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)
find min/max run loop to determine if num1>num2, num2>num3, etc.
comparing all nums in array to one another 
so that num(a)>num(b, c, d, e)=max
so that num(e)<num(a, b, c, d)=min

Print min=a
Print max=b
